In this assignment, you will build a fully functional To-Do List application using React Context API for global state management. The goal is to help you understand how to share state across multiple components without prop drilling.

Task Requirements
Create a new React project (you can use Vite or Create React App).

Use Context API to manage the to-do list state globally.

The application should include the following features:

Add new tasks

Display a list of tasks

Mark tasks as completed (strike-through effect)

Delete tasks from the list

At least 5 components should be created:

TodoProvider.jsx â€“ Manages global state

TodoForm.jsx â€“ Handles adding new tasks

TodoList.jsx â€“ Displays the list of tasks

TodoItem.jsx â€“ Represents a single task

App.jsx â€“ The main entry point that connects everything

All components must consume data from Context API instead of using props.

Use functional components and hooks (useState, useContext) only.

ðŸ”Ž Example User Flow
The user enters a task in an input field and clicks "Add Task".

The new task appears in the list below.

Clicking on a task toggles its completion state (adds a strike-through).

Clicking a "Delete" button removes the task from the list.
